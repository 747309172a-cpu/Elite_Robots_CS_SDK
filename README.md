# Elite Robots CS SDK

The SDK for Elite CS series robots.

## Requirements
 * **CS Controller** (the control software for robots) version >= **2.13.x** (for CS-Series). If the version of the robot's control software is lower than this, it is recommended to upgrade it.
 * The socket in the SDK uses **boost::asio**. Therefore, the **boost** library needs to be installed.
 * This SDK requires a compiler that supports C++17 or C++14. Note that if the C++14 standard is used, **boost::variant** will be used.
 * cmake version >= 3.22.1
