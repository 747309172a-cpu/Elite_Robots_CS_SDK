# EliteDriver Class

## Introduction
The EliteDriver is the main class for data interaction with the robot. It is responsible for establishing all necessary socket connections and handling the data exchange with the robot. The EliteDriver sends control scripts to the robot. After the robot runs the control script, it will establish communication with the EliteDriver, receive motion data, and send the motion results when necessary.

## Robot Configuration
### ***Zero the Force Sensor***
```cpp
bool zeroFTSensor()
```
- ***Function***
Resets (zeros) the force/torque values measured by the force/torque sensor applied to the tool TCP. The force/torque values are the force/torque vectors obtained by the get_tcp_force(True) script instruction, and these vectors have been processed with load compensation, etc.
After this instruction is executed, the current force/torque measurement value will be saved as the force/torque reference value, and all subsequent force/torque measurement values will be subtracted by this force/torque reference value (zeroed).
Please note that the above force/torque reference value will be updated when this instruction is executed, and will be reset to 0 after the controller is restarted.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Set the End-effector Payload***
```cpp
bool setPayload(double mass, const vector3d_t& cog)
```
- ***Function***
This command is used to set the mass, center of gravity, and moment of inertia of the robot's payload.
- ***Parameters***
    - mass: The mass of the payload.
    - cog: The coordinates of the center of gravity of the payload (relative to the flange frame).
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Set the Tool Voltage***
```cpp
bool setToolVoltage(const ToolVoltage& vol)
```
- ***Function***

- ***Parameters***
    - vol: The tool voltage.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Enable the Force Control Mode***
```cpp
bool startForceMode(const vector6d_t& reference_frame, const vector6int32_t& selection_vector, const vector6d_t& wrench, const ForceMode& mode, const vector6d_t& limits)
```
- ***Function***
Enables the force control mode.
- ***Parameters***
    - reference_frame: The pose vector that defines the force control reference coordinate system. This pose vector is defined relative to the base coordinate system. The format is [X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz], where X, Y, and Z represent the position in meters; Rx, Ry, and Rz represent the pose in radians. Rx, Ry, and Rz are defined using the standard RPY angles. selection_vector: A six-dimensional vector composed of 0s and 1s, used to define the force control axes in the force control coordinate system. 1 represents a force control axis, and 0 represents a non-force control axis.
    - selection_vector: A six-dimensional vector composed of 0s and 1s, used to define the force control axes in the force control coordinate system. 1 represents a force control axis, and 0 represents a non-force control axis.
    - wrench: The target force/torque applied by the robot to the environment. The robot will adjust its pose along/around the force control axes to achieve the specified target force/torque. The format is [Fx,Fy,Fz,Mx,My,Mz], where Fx, Fy, and Fz represent the force applied along the force control axes in Newtons; Mx, My, and Mz represent the torque applied around the force control axes in Newton-meters. This value is invalid for non-force control axes. Due to joint safety limitations, the actual applied force/torque may be lower than the set target force/torque. The actual force/torque applied to the environment can be read using the get_tcp_force script instruction in a separate thread.
    - mode: The force control mode parameter, an integer type data ranging from 0 to 3, used to define the force control mode, that is, how the force control coordinate system is defined or how it is transformed from the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 0: Fixed mode. The force control coordinate system is the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 1: Point mode. The Y-axis of the force control coordinate system points from the origin of the robot TCP to the origin of the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 2: Motion mode. The X-axis of the force control coordinate system is the projection of the TCP movement direction vector on the X-Y plane of the force control reference coordinate system.
    - limits: The speed limit parameter, a six-dimensional vector of float type data. The format is [Vx,Vy,Vz,ωx,ωy,ωz], where Vx, Vy, and Vz represent the maximum allowed TCP speed along the axis in m/s; ωx, ωy, and ωz represent the maximum allowed TCP speed around the axis in rad/s. This speed limit parameter is invalid for non-force control axes, and non-force control axes still execute the original trajectory on that axis.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Disable the Force Control Mode***
```cpp
bool endForceMode()
```
- ***Function***

- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.
